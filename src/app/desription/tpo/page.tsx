  Dear Recruiters, The Training and Placement Cell of the Central Institute of Technology Kokrajhar serves as a bridge between academia and industry, facilitating a seamless transition for our students into the professional realm. We understand the pivotal role that recruiters play in identifying and harnessing talent, and we are eager to forge lasting partnerships that benefit both our students and your organization. CIT Kokrajhar is a center of skills, innovation, and human resource development, focusing especially on fulfilling the needs of vocational and technical education in the Bodoland Territorial Region. I am glad to inform you that the majority of students at this institute are from BTR and NE India with a good number of students from other states of India too. CIT is mandated to impart technical and vocational education, such as Information Technology, Construction Technology, Food Processing Technology, Electronics and Communication Engineering, Instrumentation Engineering, Multimedia Communication and Design, etc.

 CIT started its first batch of students with a Diploma module in 2006 and has now grown into a Deemed to be University offering BTech/BDes/MTech/MDes/PhD programs in various departments. I would like to remind you all that it is next to impossible to live and cope up with the present-day world without technical knowledge. So, to help society and the country, we still need many young technical graduates and researchers. While we have IITs, NITs, IISc, and other institutes of national importance in the country, institutes like CIT Kokrajhar fulfill the aspirations and needs of many underprivileged students and students from remote places. Since assuming my additional charge as the Director of CIT Kokrajhar, I have come to know that many of our alumni are pursuing MTech and PhD in IISc/IITs and abroad, and that many are placed in various prestigious positions in the industry. These achievements are the pride of CIT Kokrajhar, and we can learn a lot from these accomplishments of the alumni.

 <br></br>

  I encourage you to explore the detailed profiles of our students, the academic programs we offer, and the various success stories that highlight the caliber of talent that emerges from CIT Kokrajhar. We look forward to the opportunity to welcome your organization to our campus, providing a platform for meaningful interactions between your representatives and our aspiring young professionals.
